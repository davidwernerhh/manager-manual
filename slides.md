Get results. Do your job. This is your first and primary responsibility.
Make mistakes, but learn from it.
Be honest, even if it makes you look bad. Don’t cover up.
Establish your self some good sense of quality awareness, go for automation if possible.
Build an understanding of the product you are building, think about Business Value.
Communicate effectively and frequently.
Think cross-functional: Engineering, Agile Processes, DevOps, QA, Infrastructure, and Performance Engineering. Don’t shy away from what you feel is out of your “comfort zone”.
Engage in knowledge sharing: share what you learned with your peers, engage in mentoring and give talks and workshops.

# How I like to work

- > email > slack > text > in-person/meeting > call
- Talking about solutions
- Status Reporting: Red, Amber, Green

---

# North Star principles

- Trust
- Regular 1:1s
- Direct feedback
- Coaching (to a point)

^
This represents how I work, what you can rely on and also where to hold me accountable for.
We get efficient when we base or work on trusting each other. This is why we should start building this trust first.
1:1s and feedback are a tool to drive that. You can also expect direct feedback from me. I will coach you, but you have to own your career and push the agenda on this.

---

# 1:1s

- Are for you
- Is not reporting
- You drive the agenda
- You own your career (but I will help)

^
If you won't fill your 1:1 agenda, I will.

# Manager "GameFace"

- Hard to read
- Sometimes, I am not clear enough
- It’s not intentional
- Ask

^
In the past, I got feedback that I am sometimes hard to read. If you don’t understand something, or how it fits into the larger picture, ask!
